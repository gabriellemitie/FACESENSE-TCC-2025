SLVR: Version solving took 0:00:00.298649 seconds.
    | Tried 1 solutions.
ERR : Because tflite_flutter_helper 0.3.0 depends on camera ^0.8.1+3 and facesense_mobile depends on camera ^0.11.3, tflite_flutter_helper 0.3.0 is forbidden.
    | So, because facesense_mobile depends on tflite_flutter_helper 0.3.0, version solving failed.
