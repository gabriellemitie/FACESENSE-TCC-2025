description: Minimal Flutter skeleton to run the converted TFLite model on-device (proof of concept).
publish_to: 'none'
version: 0.0.1
environment:
  # Allow Dart 3 (used by recent Flutter releases) so `flutter pub get` works on CI
  sdk: ">=2.18.0 <4.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  # The app uses a native MethodChannel bridge (FlexBridge) to load the
  # TensorFlow Lite Interpreter and Flex delegate on Android. This avoids
  # depending on the Dart tflite plugins which may pull in legacy Android
  # v1 embedding code. Keep only camera in Dart dependencies.
  # This PoC uses a native MethodChannel bridge for TensorFlow Lite. To
  # avoid pulling in any plugin implementations that may include the old
  # Android v1 embedding, we don't declare the `camera` plugin here. If
  # you need camera functionality later, add it back and ensure the
  # selected version uses the v2 embedding.

# No dependency_overrides in the PoC. Keep the Dart dependency graph minimal so
# the Flutter tool won't load unrelated plugin sources from the pub-cache.
